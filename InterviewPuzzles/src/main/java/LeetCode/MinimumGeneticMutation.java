/**
 * A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from "A", "C", "G", "T".
 *
 * Suppose we need to investigate about a mutation (mutation from "start" to "end"), where ONE mutation is defined as ONE single character changed in the gene string.
 *
 * For example, "AACCGGTT" -> "AACCGGTA" is 1 mutation.
 *
 * Also, there is a given gene "bank", which records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in the bank to make it a valid gene string.
 *
 * Now, given 3 things - start, end, bank, your task is to determine what is the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from "start" to "end". If there is no such a mutation, return -1.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *     Starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.
 *     If multiple mutations are needed, all mutations during in the sequence must be valid.
 *     You may assume start and end string is not the same.
